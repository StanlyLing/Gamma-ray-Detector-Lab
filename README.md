# Gamma-ray-Detector-Lab
This is a workshop about Gamma-ray detection

1. "Space Detector Lab" is the main file that contains all required raw spectrum, python analysis code and final result of the analysis.
2. This reppsitory only shows the code. To be able to access to the final code, go to the zip file on brightspace and follow the following workflow.
